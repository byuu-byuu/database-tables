# Database Tables Project

This project contains SQL files that create and populate sample database tables.  
Each `.sql` file includes both the **CREATE TABLE** statements and the **INSERT INTO** sample data.

## 📁 Files Included

- **Person.sql** — Contains customer table structure and sample records  
- **Accident.sql** — Contains product table structure and sample records  
- **Participate.sql** — Contains order table structure and sample records  

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open your SQL database software (MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, or phpMyAdmin).  
2. Import or run each `.sql` file.  
3. The tables and sample data will be created automatically.  
4. You can then run queries such as:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers;
   SELECT * FROM products;
   SELECT * FROM orders;
